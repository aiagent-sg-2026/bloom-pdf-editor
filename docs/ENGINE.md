# Bloom PDF Engine

Bloom's PDF engine is a browser-native TypeScript implementation. It parses PDF objects and content streams, renders pages to Canvas, applies edits and annotations, manages forms and page operations, and writes edited PDFs through the native writer.

## Core areas

- `src/engine/parser/` — binary lexer, object parsing, filters, and cross-reference handling
- `src/engine/content/` — content-stream tokenization and interpretation
- `src/engine/render/` — Canvas rendering, color, transparency, clipping, images, and patterns
- `src/engine/editor/` and `src/engine/editing/` — text/object editing, annotations, selection, history, and transforms
- `src/engine/forms/` — AcroForm detection, values, appearances, and flattening
- `src/engine/writer/` — serialization, incremental updates, saveQuick/saveOptimized, and page operations
- `src/lib/pdfStorage.ts` — IndexedDB-backed browser document persistence

## Invariants

The engine remains browser-native. Native content-stream editing, annotations, forms, page operations, rendering, PDF save behavior, and IndexedDB persistence must remain independent of any server conversion product surface.

## Export

The editor exports PNG, JPEG, SVG, and plain text in the browser. PDF save and optimization remain native writer operations.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
