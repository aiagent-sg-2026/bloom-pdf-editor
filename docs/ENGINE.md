# Bloom PDF Engine

Bloom's PDF engine is a browser-native TypeScript implementation. It parses PDF objects and content streams, renders pages to Canvas, applies edits and annotations, manages forms and page operations, and writes edited PDFs through the native writer.

## Core areas

- `src/engine/parser/` — binary lexer, object parsing, filters, and cross-reference handling
- `src/engine/content/` — content-stream tokenization and interpretation
- `src/engine/render/` — Canvas rendering, color, transparency, clipping, images, and patterns
- `src/engine/editor/` and `src/engine/editing/` — text/object editing, annotations, selection, history, and transforms
- `src/engine/forms/` — AcroForm detection, values, appearances, and flattening
- `src/engine/writer/` — serialization, incremental updates, saveQuick/saveOptimized, and page operations
- `src/lib/pdfStorage.ts` — IndexedDB-backed browser document persistence

## Invariants

The engine remains browser-native. Native content-stream editing, annotations, forms, page operations, rendering, PDF save behavior, and IndexedDB persistence must remain independent of any server conversion product surface.

## Export

The editor exports PNG, JPEG, SVG, and plain text in the browser. PDF save and optimization remain native writer operations.

Image compression derives candidates from the current document, including committed edits, even when serialization is larger than the upload. `compressDocumentImages` accepts `originalIsCurrent: true` only when the caller can prove the upload still represents the current document; this permits the smaller upload as the baseline and caps the result at its size. The option defaults to false.

The editor permits this fallback only for an unrecovered, unencrypted upload with unchanged exportable objects, no recorded or pending edits, and unchanged upload bytes. Saving does not reset its edit provenance. Uncertain state or a failed object comparison disables the fallback.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
